Make more dynamic Pathfinding
    Jump over blocks

Incorporate breaking blocks into pathfinding

Buddy Vision (TM) - buddy's can see what all the other buddys oin their team can.
    They will request a block that they are looking for and if that block is in another buddy's range of vision the loooking buddy will be sent where that block is located
Low / Auxilary Power mode - speed gets turned down and the buddy pathfinds to (or places) a charger
    The buddy also sends out a distress message to others on its team that it needs energy
Accessories
    Battery backpack - charges other buddys in an area around it

Mastery - as buddys do a task more they get better at it (various bonuses)
    Woodcutting, Fishing, Mining, Smithing/Upgrading, Combat, Ranged Combat
    Their skin changes based off of their current highest mastery (maybe top two)
    If the buddy maxes out a mastery they are locked out of the higher levels of other masterys

Upgrades
    Faster (more efficient) running
    Larger Battery
    Faster mining / attack speed
